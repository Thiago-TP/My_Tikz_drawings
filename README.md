# My_Tikz_drawings

Here I show some of the drawings I've done in Latex, using mainly the Tikz package. The code is overall simple, and the pictures are placed in 6 
different cattegories, according to their theme:

1 - free body diagrams; 

2 - geometry constructions;

3 - graphs (of functions);

4 - logical circuits;

5 - diagrams on the complex plane;

6 - other.

The file **MyTIkz.tex** is an all-in-one tex file holding the code for every picture, and its compilation results in the **MyTikz.pdf**.
The .tex file is commented so that, should you be insterested in one of my drawings, you can simply open it and harvest the image of interest's source code.
